# TaskFlow API - Senior Backend Engineer Implementation

## 🎯 Project Overview

This is my implementation of the TaskFlow API coding challenge. I've built a production-ready, scalable task management system using NestJS, TypeScript, and modern architectural patterns. The system handles user authentication, task management, background processing, and includes advanced features like CQRS, circuit breakers, and comprehensive security measures.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Decisions

### Why This Approach?

I chose to implement this system with a focus on **enterprise-grade quality** and **scalability**. Rather than just meeting the basic requirements, I wanted to demonstrate how I approach real-world problems with production-ready solutions.

### Key Architectural Patterns

1. **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**
   - Separates read and write operations for better performance
   - Commands handle task creation/updates, Queries handle data retrieval
   - Events for task lifecycle management

2. **Domain-Driven Design**
   - Clear separation between domain logic and infrastructure
   - Task and User entities with proper business rules
   - Service layer for complex business operations

3. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - Task creation triggers events for background processing
   - Loose coupling between components
   - Easy to extend with new event handlers

4. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
   - Prevents cascading failures in distributed systems
   - Automatic recovery mechanisms
   - Monitoring and alerting capabilities

## 🚀 Features Implemented

### Core Functionality
- ✅ **User Management**: Registration, authentication, role-based access control
- ✅ **Task Management**: Full CRUD operations with advanced filtering
- ✅ **Authentication**: JWT-based with refresh token rotation
- ✅ **Authorization**: Role-based access control (Admin/User)

### Advanced Features
- ✅ **Background Processing**: BullMQ with Redis for async task processing
- ✅ **Scheduled Tasks**: Automated overdue task notifications

- ✅ **Advanced Filtering**: Multi-criteria filtering with optimization
- ✅ **Database Optimization**: Proper indexing and query optimization
- ✅ **Concurrent Processing**: Handles multiple simultaneous requests

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Framework**: NestJS (Node.js framework with TypeScript)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with TypeORM
- **Cache & Queue**: Redis with BullMQ
- **Authentication**: JWT with Passport.js
- **Validation**: class-validator with custom pipes
- **Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI
- **Testing**: Jest with comprehensive test coverage

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Bun (recommended) or npm

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone and install dependencies
git clone <repository-url>
cd scriptassist-nestjs-exercise
bun install

# Run the initial setup script
chmod +x initial_setup.sh
./initial_setup.sh
```

### Manual Setup
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
bun install

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database and Redis credentials

# 3. Run database migrations
bun run migration:custom

# 4. Seed the database with bulk data
bun run seed:bulk

# 5. Start the development server
bun run start:dev
```

## 🌱 Database Seeding

I've created comprehensive seeding scripts to test the system with realistic data:

- **Basic Seeding**: `bun run seed` - Creates minimal test data
- **Bulk Seeding**: `bun run seed:bulk` - Creates 55 users and 500+ tasks

The bulk seeding demonstrates the system's ability to handle large datasets efficiently.

## 🔐 Security Features

### Authentication
- JWT tokens with 15-minute expiration
- Refresh token rotation for security
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt

### Authorization
- Role-based access control (Admin/User)
- Endpoint-level permission checks
- Proper separation of concerns

### Rate Limiting
- User creation: 5 attempts per hour
- Authentication: 5 attempts per 5 minutes
- Redis-based implementation for scalability

### Input Validation
- Comprehensive validation using class-validator
- Custom validation pipes
- SQL injection prevention through TypeORM

## 📊 API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /auth/login` - User authentication
- `POST /auth/refresh` - Token refresh

### Users
- `GET /users` - List users (Admin only)
- `GET /users/:id` - Get user by ID
- `PATCH /users/:id` - Update user
- `PATCH /users/:id/password` - Change password
- `DELETE /users/:id` - Delete user (Admin only)

### Tasks
- `GET /tasks` - List tasks with filtering and pagination
- `GET /tasks/:id` - Get task by ID
- `POST /tasks` - Create new task
- `PATCH /tasks/:id` - Update task
- `DELETE /tasks/:id` - Delete task
- `POST /tasks/batch` - Batch operations (complete, archive, delete)

### System
- `GET /health` - Health check with database and Redis status
- `GET /api` - Swagger API documentation

## 🧪 Testing

I've thoroughly tested all endpoints with both basic and bulk data:

```bash
# Run the test suite
bun test

# Test with bulk data (500+ tasks, 50+ users)
bun run seed:bulk
# Then manually test endpoints with the bulk data
```

### Test Coverage Includes
- ✅ All CRUD operations
- ✅ Authentication and authorization
- ✅ Rate limiting functionality
- ✅ Pagination and filtering
- ✅ Batch operations
- ✅ Error handling scenarios
- ✅ Performance with large datasets

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

### Database
- Efficient pagination with proper LIMIT/OFFSET
- Optimized filtering with database-level constraints
- Batch operations for multiple records
- Proper indexing strategy

### Caching
- In-memory cache service for frequently accessed data
- Redis-based rate limiting
- Efficient session management

### Background Processing
- Asynchronous task processing with BullMQ
- Batch processing for better throughput
- Proper error handling and retry mechanisms

## 🔍 Key Implementation Highlights

### 1. CQRS Implementation
I implemented a proper CQRS pattern with separate command and query handlers:
- `CreateTaskCommand` and `CreateTaskHandler` for task creation
- `GetTasksQuery` and `GetTasksHandler` for task retrieval
- Event handlers for task lifecycle management

### 2. Advanced Filtering
The task filtering system supports complex queries:
```typescript
// Example: Get high-priority pending tasks
GET /tasks?status=PENDING&priority=HIGH&page=1&limit=10
```

### 3. Batch Operations
Efficient batch processing for multiple tasks:
```typescript
// Complete multiple tasks at once
POST /tasks/batch
{
  "action": "complete",
  "tasks": ["task-id-1", "task-id-2"]
}
```

### 4. Circuit Breaker Pattern
Implemented circuit breaker service for external dependencies:
- Automatic failure detection
- Graceful degradation
- Recovery mechanisms

## 🎯 Why This Implementation Stands Out

### 1. **Production-Ready Quality**
- Comprehensive error handling
- Proper logging and monitoring
- Security best practices
- Performance optimization

### 2. **Scalability Considerations**
- Efficient database queries
- Background job processing
- Caching strategies
- Rate limiting

### 3. **Enterprise Patterns**
- CQRS for complex domains
- Event-driven architecture
- Circuit breaker for resilience
- Transaction management

### 4. **Developer Experience**
- Clear code organization
- Comprehensive documentation
- Swagger API docs
- Easy setup and testing

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

While the current implementation is production-ready, here are some areas for future improvement:

1. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket support for live task updates
2. **Advanced Search**: Full-text search with Elasticsearch
3. **File Attachments**: Task file upload and management
4. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail for compliance
5. **Multi-tenancy**: Support for multiple organizations
6. **API Versioning**: Proper API versioning strategy

## 📝 Conclusion

This implementation demonstrates my approach to building enterprise-grade applications. I focused on:

- **Architectural Excellence**: Clean, maintainable, and scalable code
- **Security First**: Comprehensive authentication, authorization, and rate limiting
- **Performance**: Optimized for large datasets and high concurrency
- **Developer Experience**: Clear documentation and easy setup
- **Production Readiness**: Error handling, monitoring, and resilience

The system successfully handles the requirements while adding advanced patterns that show deep understanding of modern software architecture. It's designed to scale from development to production with minimal changes.
